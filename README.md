# Analysis-of-Sea-Surface-Temperature-SST-Trends-in-the-Arabian-Sea-and-Bay-of-Bengal
This project explores the historical trends in sea surface temperature (SST) for two critical regions of the Indian Ocean: the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Using data from the HadISST dataset, covering the period from 1870 to 2021, the analysis focuses on extracting and comparing the SST trends between 1980 and 2021.

The study includes:

SST Data Extraction for both basins using latitude and longitude bounds.
Annual Averaging of SST values for the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.
Time Series Comparison of SST changes in both regions over the period from 1980 to 2021.
Trend Analysis to evaluate decadal changes and regional differences.
Spatial Mapping of SSTs across the Indian Ocean to highlight areas with the highest and lowest temperatures.
This project provides valuable insights into climate change impacts on ocean temperatures in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, critical for regional climate studies, monsoon predictions, and ecosystem health assessments.
